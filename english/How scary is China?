When Joe Biden meets Xi Jinping in San Francisco next week, the stakes will be high. Fighting in the Middle East threatens to become another theatre for great-power rivalry, 
with America backing Israel, and China (along with Russia) deepening links to Iran. 
In the South China Sea, China is harassing Philippine ships and flying its planes dangerously close to American ones. Next year will test Sino-American relations even more. 
In January a candidate despised by Beijing may win Taiwan’s presidential election. For most of the year, the race for the White House will be a cacophony of China-bashing.

America’s anti-China fervour is partly an overcorrection for its previous complacency about the economic, military and ideological threat the autocratic giant poses. 
The danger from China is real, and there are many areas where Mr Biden’s administration should stand up to its Communist rulers. 
But there is also a risk that America’s view of Chinese power slides into caricature, triggering confrontations and, at worst, an avoidable conflict. 
Even without war, that rush would incur huge economic costs, split America from its allies and undermine the values that make it strong. Instead, 
America needs a sober assessment not just of China’s strengths, but also of its weaknesses.
