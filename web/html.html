http-equiv stands for: hypertext transfer protocol equivalent and is equivalent
to HTTP response header in HTML as meta TAG has the same effect as declaring
HTTP response header Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 That is why they are
called ‘equivalent’. It is recommended to use HTTP header over HTML http-equiv
meta tags. Multiple headers with the same name may be present only if the values
may be concatenated.

<script>
     defer Attribute
    A script that will be downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing:
    <script src="demo_defer.js" defer>
</script>

note : The defer attribute is only for external scripts (should only be used if
the src attribute is present) Note: There are several ways an external script
can be executed: If async is present: The script is downloaded in parallel to
parsing the page, and executed as soon as it is available (before parsing
completes) If defer is present (and not async): The script is downloaded in
parallel to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing
If neither async or defer is present: The script is downloaded and executed
immediately, blocking parsing until the script is completed //<![CDATA[ if
