where vs having
Standard SQL doesn't allow you to refer to a column alias in a WHERE clause. 
This restriction is imposed because when the WHERE code is executed, the column value may not yet be determined.

WHERE clause allows a condition to use any table column, but it cannot use aliases or aggregate functions. HAVING clause allows a condition to use a selected (!) column, alias or an aggregate function.

This is because WHERE clause filters data before select, but HAVING clause filters resulting data after select.

select platform, count(platform) platform_total, DATE(FROM_UNIXTIME(update)) as platform_date 
from login 
where update between 1678896000 and 1678982399 
group by platform
order by platform_date;
between 1678896000 and 1678982399;
