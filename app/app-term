in app browser 
WebView is an embeddable browser that a native application can use to display web content.
So, a WebView is sort of like an iframe that you can embed in your native application.

One could think of In-App Browsers or Embedded browsers as a use case of WebViews -A common place example of this is a feature that you would see in social media apps like facebook, twitter etc where in whenever there is a hyperlink, on click on which you would be redirected to a browser within the native app itself, instead of opening the link on full-fledged browser app.
